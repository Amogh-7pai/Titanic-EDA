# Titanic-EDA
"In this comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic dataset, we dissect the tragic 1912 shipwreck through modern data science techniques. Our investigation reveals compelling patterns behind the infamous 'women and children first' narrative, quantifying survival probabilities across passenger classes, age groups, and family structures. Using Python's data analysis stack (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), we:

Verified data integrity and preprocessed key features

Identified 62.9% overall fatality rate with stark disparities:

81% male mortality vs 26% female mortality

24% 3rd-class survival vs 63% 1st-class survival

Discovered children under 10 had 59% survival rate vs 34% for 60+

Visualized fare distributions showing survivors paid 2X median fare

Revealed passengers with 1-3 family members had optimal survival odds

The analysis transforms historical tragedy into quantifiable insights, demonstrating how socioeconomic factors dramatically influenced life-or-death outcomes during humanity's most infamous maritime disaster."
